This project utilizes machine learning to recognize hand gestures and control a presentation. The system captures live video input, processes it using a pre-trained deep learning model, and interprets hand gestures to trigger presentation actions (e.g., next slide, previous slide).
One can also write and erase a text written using hand gesture
